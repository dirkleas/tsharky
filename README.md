# tsharky

**tsharky** is a minimalist demo of using tshark (wireshark) traffic as source input in max

this assumes [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) + 
[pythonosc](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-osc) to monitor
some wifi traffic, and CNMAT Externals from the Max 7 Package manager to easily parse
the incoming osc traffic

usage is simple, start the monitor with **python3 tsharky.py** in a terminal/shell window,
then open the max patch too show traffic through the Max Console. once you see what's 
coming through, parse it and map it into your own max mischief!

enjoy,
D
